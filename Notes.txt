Score? can we determine a score overall, like GPLRank?
Enter athlete ID to compare to? or would you need permissions?

Authorization
=============

Go to https://www.strava.com/oauth/authorize?client_id=15489&response_type=code&redirect_uri=http://localhost
Authorize the app, you will be redirected to localhost which likely won't work. In any case, grab the value of the "code" query string parameter
Using Fiddler, craft a POST to https://www.strava.com/oauth/token with the following query string values

client_id=15489
client_secret=bb5b58c47a3d39bd16ea98483b3d9fde4c034fbc
code=<The code captured from the query string>

Grab access_token from the response JSON

Browse to index.html with a query string of ?athleteId=<Your Athlete ID>&accessToken=<The access token you just got>

Hopefully after a few moments to fetch the data, the tables will be populated.
